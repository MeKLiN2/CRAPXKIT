RUN APPX.BAT BY OPENING A DOS PROMPT IN PE SHELL/WINDOWS 10 DVD INSTALLER, BY PRESSING SHIFT + F10.
RUN THIS MULTIPLE TIMES, IF YOU WANT, BUT SPECIFICALLY BEFORE YOU REBOOT. YOU MUST GO BACK TO
THE WINDOWS 10 DVD INSTALLER AFTER YOU FIRST REBOOT FROM IT. IT WILL INSTALL, SAY PATCHES UPDATES,
THEN IT WILL REBOOT, DO NOT GO TO WINDOWS, REBOOT FROM DVD AGAIN. OPEN YOUR NEW UNTOUCHED WINDOWS
BY MOUNTING IT (JUST CLICK IT, THEN CLICK MIDDLE OF APP SCREEN) WITH DISM++X64.EXE ... GREAT TOOL
MY SCRIPTS ARE MEANT TO TARGET THE LOCATION THE REGISTRY APPEARS WHEN ITS MOUNTED. THERE WILL BE UPDATES
TO THIS WHICH MAKE IT TARGET BOTH REGS, INCASE YOU ARE 'ON THE WINDOWS' BUT IF YOU ARE BY THAT TIME
YOU ARE RAPED BY WINDOWS UPDATES WHICH ON FIRST BOOT IS 50K REG KEYS ADDED FOR 50 APPS THAT SUCK. I
LEAVE ONLY WINDOWS UI XAML AND CLOUD HOST FOR OOBE. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT WINDOWS IF U USE THE RIGHT VERSION AS ME, AND
U MUST TAKE APPXPROVISIONING.XML AND FIX IT LIKE MINE, OR TAKE MINE, AND REPLACE ALL. WINDOWS APPS FOLDER, SXS, AND PROGRAMDATA.
